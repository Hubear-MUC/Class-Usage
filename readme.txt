ClassUsage 1.0
-----------

First usage of the class concept within this project of knowledge regaining in coding.

1  class a{public:int a,b;};
2  a o;int r;
3  main()
4  {
5  r=o.a+o.b;
6  }

Usage:

The usage and the working of this program are very simple. In fact it is just a replica of the addition- programs published earlier.

Just set breakpoints at lines 4 and 6 and run the program.

Then set the variables

  o.a
  
and

  o.b
  
to the values that should be added together.

Mind that this addition just can be done with integer- numbers due to the limited code space.

continue the program to the breakpoint at line 6 and examine the result in variable r.


The speciality of this program is that the numbers were stored inside an object, not just in simple variables.

However there was no code space left for a method doing the actual calculation. This should be done in a later version of this program.
